This repository contains a comprehensive, curated collection of high-performance tools, registry tweaks, automation scripts, and pre-configured setup templates designed to optimize Windows 10 & 11. Built with gaming performance, privacy, and system debloating as primary goals, this suite bridges the gap between hardware limitations and operating system overhead.

> [!WARNING]
> These optimization scripts apply system-wide changes, alter service parameters, and disable telemetry/security configurations. Always create a **System Restore Point** before running scripts, and backup critical files.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Performance Engineering:** Tailored registry tweaks for CPU priorities, SSD alignment, network latency, and advanced power plans.
*   **Privacy & Bloatware Control:** Broad-spectrum telemetry blocking, service adjustments, and deep removal of pre-installed background apps.
*   **Unattended OS Setup:** Automated Windows 11 installation templates that bypass RAM/TPM/Secure Boot checks automatically.
*   **Essential Diagnostic Toolkit:** Hand-picked open-source utilities for hardware monitoring, latency analysis, and driver stability.

## 🛠️ Quick Start Guide

1.  **System Preparation:** Before running any tweak, launch Windows PowerShell as Administrator and run:
    ```powershell
    Checkpoint-Computer -Description "Pre-Optimization Backup"
    ```
2.  **Run the Main Optimizer:** Navigate to the `Tweaks/` folder, right-click `Apply Optimizations.bat`, and select **Run as administrator**. Select your optimization profile from the interactive menu.
3.  **Ensure Stable Drivers:** Run the utilities inside `Drivers/` to detect hardware and update core display and chipset systems.
4.  **Debloat Temporary Files:** Run `Tweaks\Storage\Safe Temporary Cleanup.bat` to clear systemic caches, prefetch stores, and temp files.
