## 🎯 Guided Paths by Use Case

To help you get the most out of your optimization process, identify your use case below and follow the linked documentation paths:

### 🎮 Gamers (Maximum FPS & Low Latency)
1. Apply CPU priorities and the custom power plan via [**System Tweaks**](TWEAKS.md).
2. Configure Message Signaled-Based Interrupts using the guide in [**Extra Utilities**](EXTRA.md).
3. Ensure display optimizations are active by consulting [**Display Tweaks**](TWEAKS.md#4-display-tweaks).
4. Update display and chipset drivers via [**Driver Management**](DRIVERS.md).

### 💻 Legacy / Low-End PCs (<8GB RAM & Weak CPUs)
1. Turn off visual transparency and animations using [**Appearance Tweaks**](TWEAKS.md#1-appearance-tweaks).
2. Configure automatic RAM cleaning with [**Mem Reduct Guide**](TWEAKS.md#memory-reduction).
3. Switch update routines off using [**Windows Update Controls**](WINDOWS_UPDATE.md) if you do not use the Microsoft Store.
4. Clean bloated caches using the [**Aggressive Storage Cleanup**](TWEAKS.md#11-storage-aggressive-tweaks) guide.

### 🔒 Privacy-Minded Users (Zero Telemetry)
1. Stop data collection routines using [**Telemetry Tweaks**](TWEAKS.md#telemetry-data-collection).
2. Restrict systemic access permissions via [**Privacy Tweaks**](TWEAKS.md#7-privacy-tweaks).
3. Transition to a telemetry-free browser by reading the [**Web Browsers Guide**](BROWSERS.md).
4. Consider performing a clean, fully-privatized OS setup using the [**Unattended Installation XML**](AUTOUNATTEND.md).

## ⚠️ Important Precautions

> [!WARNING]
> - Always perform a **System Restore Point** creation before running any scripts.
> - Some tweaks disable core security components (Windows Defender, SmartScreen). Only apply these modifications if you have alternative safeguards active or operate in secure isolated environments.
> - Read the [**Antivirus Guide**](ANTIVIRUS.md) to understand recommended modern scanning setups.
